# Challenge 1 - Basic Layout Implementation with HTML and Vanilla CSS

## Description

In this assignment, you will implement the basic structure and visual style of a simple webpage using HTML and Vanilla CSS (without any additional CSS frameworks or libraries). The design you need to follow can be seen at the following Figma link:

[Figma Design Link](https://www.figma.com/design/31CrRTw480Y91OWyxWqqj8/Challenge-1---Batch-4?node-id=8411-143671&p=f&t=z4rvc4xN6W15E9pz-0)

Breakpoint screen size: mobile < 768px, tablet 768â€“1024px, desktop > 1024px.

The goal of this assignment is to test your understanding of basic HTML structure, the use of CSS selectors, the box model, and your ability to translate visual designs into code.

## Folder Structure

Below is the initial folder structure that has been provided for your project:

- `Assets/images/`: This folder is used to store all images you might need in the design.
- `Css/index.css`: This is where you will write all the CSS code to style your webpage.
- `index.html`: This is the main HTML file where you will create the structure of your webpage.

## Assignment Objectives

1.  **Semantic HTML Structure:** Create a good and semantic HTML structure according to the layout in the Figma design. Use the appropriate HTML tags for each element (e.g., `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, `<h1>` to `<h6>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`, `<a>`, `<img>`, etc.).
2.  **Visual Styling with Vanilla CSS:** Implement the visual style of the webpage using pure CSS. Pay attention to things like:
    - Element layout (e.g., using Flexbox or CSS Grid if necessary).
    - Colors, fonts, text sizes, and other visual properties.
    - Spacing (margin and padding) between elements.
3.  **Simple Responsiveness (Optional):** If the Figma design shows different layouts for different screen sizes, try to implement simple responsiveness using _media queries_ in your CSS.
4.  **Design Element Implementation:** Ensure that all the main visual elements in the Figma design (such as icons, images, and simple interactive elements) are accurately implemented.
5.  **Responsive Testing:** You can test the responsiveness of your design using the _playground_ feature available on the top right of the Figma window when you open the design. This feature allows you to see how the design adapts to various common screen sizes.

## Example Workflow

1.  **Study the Design:** Open the Figma link and understand the layout, elements, colors, and fonts used in the design. Observe how these elements are arranged on different screen sizes (if any) using the _playground_ on the top right.
2.  **HTML Structure:** Create the `index.html` file and write the basic HTML structure according to the design. Identify the main sections of the page (header, navigation, main content, footer, etc.) and use relevant HTML tags.
3.  **CSS Styling:** Create or edit the `Css/index.css` file to provide visual styles to your HTML elements. Use CSS selectors to target the appropriate elements and apply CSS properties according to the design.
4.  **Testing:** Open the `index.html` file in your browser and compare the result with the design in Figma. Use the browser's _developer tools_ (usually by pressing F12) to test responsiveness on various screen sizes. Also, compare with the appearance in the Figma _playground_. Make adjustments to your HTML and CSS until the appearance matches the design on different screen sizes.

## Evaluation System

The evaluation for this assignment will be based on the following criteria:

1.  **Design Accuracy:** How accurately your implementation matches the design provided in Figma across different screen sizes.
2.  **Semantic HTML Usage:** The correct and appropriate use of HTML tags according to the content structure.
3.  **Effective CSS Usage:** The correct and efficient use of CSS selectors, as well as understanding of basic CSS properties and _media queries_ (if responsiveness is implemented).
4.  **Code Readability and Organization:** HTML and CSS code that is well-structured, easy to read, and commented where necessary.
